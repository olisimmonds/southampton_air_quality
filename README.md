# Southampton Air Quality Policy Brief

Working for Dr Christina Vanderwel of the University of Southampton and the local councils of Hampshire, I did an in-depth analysis of air quality in the area to help published policy brief which can be found in the link below. The results from my investigations were unique and offered a new understanding of air quality in Hampshire which will be used directly to help guide policy and improve local air quality.
