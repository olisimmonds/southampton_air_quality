# Southampton Air Qality Policy Breif

Working for Dr Christina Vanderwel of the University of Southampton and the local councils of Hampshire, I did an in-depth analysis of air quality in the area to help build a published policy breif. The results from my investigations were unique and offered a new understanding of air quality in Hampshire which will be used directly to help guide policy and improve local air quality.
